If you are eager to play the game without waiting for Ubisoft to fix the UPlay issues, there is a simple workaround that you can use. All you have to do is switch UPlay to 'offline' mode in the settings menu. This will allow you to launch and play the game without any connection to UPlay servers. Unlike some of Ubisoft's previous titles, UPlay is not used as a form of digital rights management (DRM) for this game, so you don't have to worry about losing your progress or achievements when you play offline.
